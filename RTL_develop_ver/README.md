
This is a development version that can reach a frequency of 185MHz.

It currently only supports the "Pseudo-LS" manner described in the paper [1], so it is slightly lossy (rather than lossless).

It have no known functional bugs, but the code is written in SystemVerilog (not Verilog) and is not very standardized.

When I have time, I will modify it to both "Lossless" manner and "Pseudo-LS" manner, and let it be the stable version.
